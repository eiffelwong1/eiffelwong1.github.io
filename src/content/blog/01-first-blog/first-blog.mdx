import { Picture, Image } from 'astro:assets';
import oldWebPic from "./old-website.png"

This is the first blog post, published the same day as this website first went live. As my personaly skill in front-end developemnt grows, I very soon notice that the old website those cool, it's a bit limiting and not very suited for my vision of making this a blog too.

So this time I have went with Astro, typescript, react, tailwindcss, as the main tech stack.


## Old website

My old personal website are here: https://github.com/eiffelwong1/old_personal_website

<Picture src={oldWebPic} alt="three.js section of my old website" alt="my old website; the 3js section" />

it was built with vite, react, css, and 3js. it was kinda a playground for me to gain more experience in front-end development. I'm still very proud of it, but it's time to move on.

used as personal website Feb 2023 to Feb 2024, fairwell :D

currently there's no live demo avaliable, but you can clone the repo and run it locally.

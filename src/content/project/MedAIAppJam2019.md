# Medical AI App Jam 2019
Awarded The Most Creative Use of AI Award

In collaboration with a team of Medical Students, we developed vAItal Signs: an Android app that applies computer learning to predict when a patient with a brain bleed or head trauma in the critical care setting is going to have a subsequent brain bleed from a set of clinically relevant vitals.

Trained the model using a decision tree algorithm in python to predict the risk of cerebral herniation in patients with brain bleeds and transfer the model into JAVA.

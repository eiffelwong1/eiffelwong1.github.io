For some reason, got into amateur radio, and wanted to learn more about morse code, but realize there isn't a really cool website like typemonkey for morse code; a typing website that focuses on user experience and design. So I decided to make one myself.

I'll be taking my amateur radio license soon, and I'm excited about it

There are some plans to continue to develop this website, and I'm excited to see where it goes.
